// What leaves the process and what reaches the disk while the mod drives (see record_gate.hpp).
//
// The function-level gate keeps the level's record from being written. These are the two doors
// under it, shut for the same reason and on the same predicate (botDriving()): a bot's session
// is not a player's, so nothing it does may be sent to a server or written into a save file --
// whichever of the game's functions ends up asking, including ones this mod has never heard of.
//
// Measured on the 2.209 binary:
//   - every request the game makes goes through CCHttpClient::send (7 callers in the executable;
//     the death-data upload is built in LevelInfoLayer::onEnterTransitionDidFinish and needs a
//     logged-in account);
//   - CCGameManager.dat / CCLocalLevels.dat are written by DS_Dictionary::saveRootSubDictTo-
//     CompressedFile, whose only caller is GManager::save;
//   - CCPlatformerSave.dat (new in 2.209) is written through one atomic writer (RVA 0x736b0),
//     called from PlayLayer::onQuit and the account sync. PlayLayer::onQuit tests whether the
//     level is a platformer, not the test-mode flag, so the guard the record gate raises does
//     not cover it -- this hook does.
