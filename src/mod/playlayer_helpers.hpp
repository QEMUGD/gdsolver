// ---- Progress recording: use GD's own "do not record" path ----
// PlayLayer::destroyPlayer and PlayLayer::levelComplete write the level's record -- percentage,
// attempts, orbs, diamonds, the completion flag -- and BOTH gate that whole block on
// `m_isTestMode` (GJBaseGameLayer +0x3230, the flag GD sets when a level is played from a start
// position). Setting it around the original call makes GD skip the recording itself, which
// covers every path inside those functions instead of the handful a hook list can enumerate.
//
// IT IS SCOPED ON PURPOSE. `m_isTestMode` is not only read by the recording code:
// `GJBaseGameLayer::updateCamera` reads it too and skips a camera clamp when it is set. The
// camera is not decoration here -- the flight band and camera-driven triggers follow it, and a
// changed camera would change the simulation. So the flag is raised for the duration of the
// original call and put straight back; updateCamera runs in the tick loop and never sees it.
//
// 2.209 also keeps the time spent on a level in its record -- first- and last-played timestamps and two
// play-time counters (save keys k138, k139, k142, k143, with k133 marking them valid). The function that
// commits them is called with no test-mode test, and destroyPlayer carries inline copies of the same
// writes, so the flag does not stop them. PlayTimeRecord209 is how they are undone: the five ints are
// read before the original runs and put back after it, the way restoreProgress treats the counters GD
// writes outside its guarded block. (Found by the memory audit: a driven session that died showed k133
// appear in the level's record.)
