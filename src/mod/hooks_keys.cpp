// The keyboard path the mod's keybind settings need on GD 2.209.
//
// The mod's hotkeys (overlay, pause, step, speed, seek, ...) are Geode keybind settings. Geode delivers them
// from its own hook on CCKeyboardDispatcher::dispatchKeyboardMSG, which posts a KeyboardInputEvent that the
// keybind settings listen to. That hook is part of Geode.dll, built for 2.2081, and Geode's forward-compatibility
// mode on 2.209 does not install it: no key ever reaches a keybind setting, so none of the hotkeys worked
// (measured: F2 / F1 / Up pressed for real in a replay changed nothing, while Escape closed the play menu).
// This is the same hook, written in the mod, where it is compiled against this mod's bindings. It posts the
// event and, as Geode's does, lets a listener that takes the key stop it.
//
// Not built for 2.2081: Geode's own hook is there, and two would deliver every key twice.
