// death run showed (dvy -0.300 .. -0.129 over 40 ticks, runO4 iter 14..26,
// t=2091..2131) was just this ramp shrinking as the ball fell through it.

// on the tick an orb FIRES (the model's 0.115 px "dash started early" residue
// at t=2092 was this term missing from the firing tick's integration).
// The gate is circle-vs-circle, NOT the AABB: entering from above, the AABB

// (effect from 2107, one tick later). All six measured entry/exit edges

// 0.304/0.159 = 1.912 is close to the robot/ship gravity ratio 0.195/0.103 = 1.893,

// the other measurements in the table (11412=0.283 robot / 17701=0.330 robot /

//
// [2026-08-30] THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS KEPT BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT AND WAS THROWN

// collapses onto one number.
//
// The FIRST attempt at that number was 1/0.9581990, the dt at kRobotHoverTicks,
// picked because dividing the four corpus values by the QUANTISED gravity gives
// 1.042/1.045/1.043/1.047 and 1.04362 sits in the middle. It was wrong twice
// over -- the divisor is 0.96 and the gravity is the unquantised one -- and it
// cost three regressions, because "a constant we already have is close to the
// answer" is a coincidence, not a derivation. The ladder below is what settled
// it, and it settled it by making the measurement precise enough that the two
// candidates could not both fit.

//   cube  push 2.250, |g| 0.216 -- IDENTICAL to full size
//   ball  push 1.350, |g| 0.129 -- IDENTICAL to full size
// which is what the law predicts: neither mode's gravity changes with size, so
// neither does its push. forceUnitFor therefore does not take a size, and for
// six of the eight modes that is measured rather than assumed.
//
// THE SWING IS THE EXCEPTION AND IT DOES NOT FIT. Its gravity DOES change with
// size (kSwingGMini 0.129 against kSwingG 0.086, confirmed here by the fall
// after the box), so the law predicts 10 * 0.129/kForceGDiv - 0.129 = +1.221
// net. GD gives +1.2560/tick, held for seven ticks -- 2.9% out, far outside the
// 0.001 grid. Two things confound the reading and neither is resolved:
//   - GD reports onGround=1 for the whole climb, at vy up to 9. If gravity is
//     not being applied at all there, the push is 0.1256 per unit, which is not
//     a clean scale either.
//   - the mini swing clamps at vy 9.385 while the full one does not clamp at
//     all (see kSwingTerm), so the window is short.
// Left as the full-size value: no level in lv1-22 puts a mini swing in a force
// box, so the model cannot be measured against the difference, and 0.1256 vs
// 0.1385 cannot be told apart without settling the gravity question first.
// A TYPE, not a double, and that is the whole point. This function replaced one
// that took a gravity, six call sites had to change, three of them did, and
// because both were `double` IT COMPILED AND RAN. The sites still passing a
// gravity gave 1.4 x 0.195 = 0.273 where GD gives 0.283 at uid11412 -- and five

//                                          +42, +183 and +254 ticks, not 500+.

//                                          written; it does not change the
//                                          verdict, which turns on the corpus
//                                          having no firing anywhere near 500.)
//     "went off again 638 px past"      -- no firing in the current reference is
//                                          at 638 px; the observation is from an

//                                          with the route, cf. the corridor ticks
//                                          in step.hpp's acquireFlip note).

//
//   VERIFIED, and every one of these came from the DISASSEMBLY rather than from
//   that pass -- which is the audit's actual finding, since the file's readings
//   held and its one behavioural generalisation did not:
//     the counter is set to a small immediate and decremented every tick
//       -- 0x215ba1 `mov [r14+0xb80], 2`, 0x389f40 `dec [r15+0xb80]`, the latter
//          straight-line in update whose 915-instruction prefix has exactly one
//          exit (m_isDead) skipping it.
//     didHitHead's body, line for line -- 0x393c30, including the +-2 and the
//       m_stateNoAutoJump clear.
//     the 1859 sibling's "set to 2 by the touch and stepped down every tick"
//       (line ~360) -- 0x215ac6 sets 0xb7c to 2, 0x389f47 decrements it. The
//       SAME claim shape as the refuted one, from the same reading, and correct.
//
//   IMPRECISE: the range "+0x1146..+0x1196" does not contain 2866's branch. That
//     range holds 0xb74/0xb78/0xb7c/0xb88; `cmp ecx, 0xb32` jumps OUT of it to
//     0x215ba1 (+0x1241).
//
//   AND THE ARM HAS A SECOND CONSUMER, so "the only reader ... is didHitHead"
//     below is wrong -- and wrong the day it was written, not stale:
//     collidedWithObjectInternal, which the very next sentence names as the
//     caller, tests it itself at 0x391e4b (+0x3db, `> 0`) to compute a local
//     boolean, four instructions after m_stateHitHead and the platformer flag.
//     GD uses the arm as a COLLISION MODIFIER with two consumers; the model
//     treats it as a flip enable.
//
// WHAT IS STILL OPEN: the binary says 2 ticks and GD flips 42 ticks after
// arming. Nothing here closes that -- see State::fgArm.
// TIME WARP (object id 1935, EffectGameObject::m_timeWarpTimeMod, dumped as the
// objrects `tw` column). GD scales TIME, so within one tick the x advance, the
// y integration and the velocity increment all shrink by the same factor --

// whole difference between the two paths. Measured on lv22's cold of 2026-09-30 (bundle
// v5): the t=2,076 search was given a recording whose uid2860 had followed a run that left
// the playfield (y 757 at t=2,850 against the candidates' 290-330), so under --fgarmlive
// no low candidate was ever armed, all of them died at x~4,030-4,105 on the first ceiling
// or side contact, and the only survivor was the arc into the sky. Same flags without
// --fgarmlive crossed that wall from the same anchor and inputs.
//
// WHAT GD DOES, read from the binary (2.2081):
//   - the arm is renewed on every tick of contact: collisionCheckObjects' per-object loop
//     writes 2 into m_stateFlipGravity (player+0xb80) for an id-2866 (0x215ba1, on
//     `cmp ecx,0xb32`) and into m_stateHitHead (+0xb7c) for an id-1859 (0x215ac6, on
//     `cmp ecx,0x743`); PlayerObject::update decrements both every tick (0x389f40 /
//     0x389f47). So: armed on the contact tick and the one after (kArmTicks).
//   - a Move locked to the player moves its group by the player's own displacement:
//     GJBaseGameLayer::update stores player.position - player.m_lastPosition into the
//     effect manager (+0x800 x, +0x804 y; 0x238222-0x2382b2, with a y-only teleport
//     guard at 0x23823f-0x238266), and GJEffectManager::prepareMoveActions, for a move
//     command with m_lockToPlayerX (+0x73) / m_lockToPlayerY (+0x74), takes that times
//     the move's mod as the step's delta. So the group keeps a FIXED offset from the
//     player for the whole ride -- the offset it had when the Move fired.
//   - measured against the trunk clear of 2026-09-30 (lv22 attempt 52): recorded box(t)
//     minus the player's position at t-1 is constant to 0.001 px over the whole ride --
//     uid2860 (0.765, 6.000) over 648 ticks, uid2152 (0.901, 6.000) over 387.
//
// SO THE ARM DURING A RIDE IS A PROPERTY OF THE STATE, NOT OF THE RECORDING: with the
// offset fixed, the player overlaps the box on every tick of the ride exactly when it
// overlapped it on the tick the ride began -- which is the tick before the box's first
// moving row, where the box is still at its load-time place. The model therefore takes
// only the WINDOW from the recording (rideT0..rideT1) and, inside it, renews the arm
// exactly when it was renewed on the previous tick (the counter at its fresh value);
// before the window the load-time box is tested as usual. Nothing reads the recorded
// position of a riding box.
//
// Scope and the holes it leaves, all written down rather than guessed at:
//   - both axes locked (lockx && locky on an autonomous Move reaching the box). A box
//     locked on one axis keeps the pre-flag reading and the loader says so.
//   - the window comes from the recording; a recording without the ride (the flight
//     died before it) gives no window, and the box is then read as parked.
//   - after the ride the box stands wherever it stopped, which depends on the state's
//     own path again; nothing renews the arm there (it lapses in kArmTicks). GD keeps
//     renewing while the player still overlaps the stopped box.
//   - the offset is exact only while the player's half-size does not change inside
//     the ride; a growing half cannot lose the overlap, a shrinking one could.
//   - "renewed last tick" is one counter per arm kind, so two riding boxes of the same
//     kind would share it (lv22 has one of each).
//   - GD's y guard on a teleport (above) breaks the fixed offset; not modelled.
// Implies --fgarmlive's counter (decays, kArmTicks) for the 2866; the 1859 already had
// it. With both flags, --ridebox decides for riding boxes and --fgarmlive's live reading

// touch and decays it every tick, so the window is the touch tick and the one
// after it (kArmTicks).
//
// MEASURED, three points, 2026-09-01 (worker 98):
//   lv22 (22,365): five 1859 at cy=2,055 under a ceiling whose underside is
//        2,070. A FULL-SIZE cube injected at y=2,035 rising at vy=20 stops dead
//        at y=2,055.000 with vy=0 and falls away -- the bonk.
//   lv18 (24,345): the same full-size cube into a plain ceiling (underside 240,
//        no modifier objects anywhere near) DIES.
//   lv11 (4,500):  a MINI cube into a plain continuous ceiling DIES.
// So the discriminant is neither the size nor the mode: ~~it is this object~~.
// The model's old `mode == robot || (cube && mini)` was its proxy, which is why
// f3ca55d had to limit the bonk to mini to stop it firing where GD kills.
//
// [2026-09-07] **"IT IS THIS OBJECT" IS WRONG -- 1859 IS ONE OF THREE INPUTS.**
// Read at the gate itself (collidedWithObjectInternal +0x3ce..+0x3e2): the local
// boolean that selects resolution over kill is set by
//     m_stateHitHead (0xb7c) > 0   OR   platformer (0xb70)   OR
//     m_stateFlipGravity (0xb80) > 0
// -- the last being the id-2866 arm, four instructions below the other two. So a
// live 2866 also puts a classic ground mode into the resolution arm, and this
// sentence would tell anyone reasoning about ceiling resolution the wrong thing.
// Marked here rather than folded into State::fgArm's record because that is
// where this claim is met.
//
// INDEPENDENT of everything about the 2866 arm's LIFETIME: this is about what
// FEEDS the gate, not how long the counter lives. The model's bonk gate reads
// only armT (the 1859 side).
//
// AND THE FAILURE MODE IS THE SAME ONE AS THE ceilramp NOTE'S: the paragraph
// this sits in was written about 1859 and is silently wrong about MEMBERSHIP --
// right about what it measured, silent about the axis it never varied. That is
// the second time today a note's blind spot rather than its content was the
// defect (the 2866 paragraph below was written about permanence and was silently
// wrong about the reader set). Worth treating as a pattern, not a tally.
//
// WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG: a fourth input to that boolean, or the 2866 branch
// being unreachable for the classic ground modes. Look at
// collidedWithObjectInternal +0x3ce..+0x3e2 and at what [rsp+0x35] gates
// (0x392474 and 0x3928ed).
// The armed-mini case (lv22's switch band, 1859 at (3,195,255)) is covered by
// the verified solutions that run through it.
//
// [2026-09-26] THE BOX IS READ AT ITS LIVE POSITION, like the 2866's under
// --fgarmlive, and for the same reason: lv22's switch-band 1859 (uid2152, group
// 21) RIDES THE PLAYER. A move trigger locked to the player's x carries it from
// t=2,445 for 1.61 s, 1.95 px a tick, so GD re-arms on every tick of the ride.
// Read at the parked (3,195,255) the model lets the arm lapse two ticks after
// the player walks off the parked box, and a mini cube that GD clamps under
// uid2182 at t=2,484 (y 261.000, vy 0) dies on the block's side at 2,487.
// Measured in the game (worker 99, 5f13395's lv22 plan): GD clamps with the arm
// last renewed 27, 31, 39, 67, 147, 87, 177 or 277 ticks earlier by the parked
// box's reckoning (the player held at x 3,221.5 or 3,240 by injection), and
// kills once the attempt never overlaps the box -- teleported from x 3,164 or
// 3,168 to 3,221.5, so the box rides 26 px behind. The counter's two-tick life

// the box bottom 1,020.0 of the 1829s at cy=1,035) and 1,021.603 at t=9,410;

// as the force field and the 2866 arming below. lv21 has 12 of these but its
// verified plan never overlaps one mid-dash (quick_regress must stay identical).
