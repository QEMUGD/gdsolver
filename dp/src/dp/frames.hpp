// ---- MOVING GEOMETRY ------------------------------------------------------
//
// Everything above is a STATIC grid: the objrects dump is one snapshot taken at
// level entry, and the whole model treats it as the truth for all 30,000 ticks.
// That holds for lv1-18, which contain exactly ZERO moving objects
// (scripts/mechanic_census.ps1, "movable" column), and it collapses at lv19,
// where the same column reads 820 / 1,015 / 1,731 / 761 for lv19-22.
//
// The failure is not subtle. lv19's cold DP dies at x=1,459 because the static
// grid has nothing to stand on there -- while GD, replaying a working plan, has
// the player GROUNDED at (1,352, 131.6). The thing it is standing on is
// `id 470 type 0 groups=1`, which the dump lists at (1,365, **45**), i.e. below
// the floor: it rises into place before the player arrives. lv22 is the same
// shape at x=525 and it is what stops that level at x=604.
//
// Rather than implement GD's trigger system (move / rotate / toggle / spawn,
// with easing), the MOD records what actually happened: `grouptrace=1` writes
// `tick,uid,cx,cy,w,h` for every grouped object, every tick it changes. That
// makes rotation and scaling fall out for free -- they change the rect, and the
// rect is all the model ever asks for.
//
// Between two samples an object holds its last rect, and past the final sample
// it holds it forever. That is exactly right for a platform that has finished
// moving, which is the common case: the trigger fires when the object comes on
// SCREEN, so a platform is normally already in place by the time the player
// reaches it.
// `on` is GD's own toggle state (GameObject::m_isGroupDisabled). A toggle does
// NOT move the object, so a recorder that watched positions alone would report
// a wall that never changes -- which is exactly what lv19 x=27,705 looked like:
// two 30x30 blocks filling the only 60 px gap in a wall the player flies
// straight through.
// ---- ROTATED GAMEPLAY (id 2900) --------------------------------------------
//
// GD 2.2 turns the whole gameplay frame: the world does not move, the player's
// travel direction and gravity do. lv22 has 20 of these (no other level in the
// suite has any, so all of this is inert there).
//
// Measured on lv22 with the reference replay (2026-08-13):
//   - `rot` is the ABSOLUTE screen angle, not a delta. Eight of lv22's twenty
//     are rot=0, i.e. "turn it back".
//   - travel = R(-rot) * xhat:  0 -> +X,  90 -> -Y,  180 -> -X,  270 -> +Y.
//     uid 1343 (2265,316, rot=90): from t=1,747 x freezes at 2,266.5 and y
//     falls 1.2982/tick (= the section's dx). uid 6286 (16125,489, rot=-90):
//     x freezes at 16,131 and y RISES 1.298/tick.
//   - it fires on the tick AFTER the player's forward coordinate crosses the
//     object's -- the same crossing+1 rule every autonomous trigger uses. The
//     boxes overlap for ~15 ticks before that and nothing happens.
//   - the world VELOCITY carries over: the forward speed becomes the new
//     perpendicular one, and the old perpendicular is dropped (the forward
//     speed is the section's, not a free variable).
//
// The model keeps its state in the CURRENT frame's coordinates, so every
// physics rule stays written as "x is the clock, y is height"; what changes is
// the geometry handed to it. (u,v) = R(-rot)*(X,Y), which for 90-degree
// multiples is a pure index swap with signs -- an AABB stays an AABB with
// hw/hh swapped.

// --capinsetgate (always on since 2026-10): the spiked-ramp kill's caps sit at the box's edge

// ---- THE ANCHOR PAYLOAD ----------------------------------------------------
//
// `--start` carries the physics state. It does NOT carry the values whose
// worth at tick t depends on the ticks before t, so an anchor begins those at
// their defaults and unmakes what the run had already done: State::fireB read
// as "fired at tick 0", State::lockOff as "never rode anything", the rotation
// queue's three as "channel 0, nothing consumed". Three defects on 2026-09-04,
// one shape.
//
// Seeding them from the recording goes as far as the recording goes and no
// further -- 768 unexpected differences on lv22 became 163, and the remainder
// is boxes whose objects have no recording at all. Those have to come from GD,
// which knows.
//
// NAMED, NOT POSITIONAL. The positional --start fields (30 today, 26 when this was written) cannot take another
// one without every reader changing, and appending after an optional field is
// its own trap. So: `--anchor-state key=value;key=value`.
//
// TRIGGERS ARE NAMED BY UID, NOT BY BIT. Bit numbering is a property of this
// build's 32-box window; a bit index crossing the boundary would mean a
// different box whenever the window moved.
//
// AND THE TOUCH IS p1's ONLY. markTouched reads p1's position, so a bit set
// from "either player entered it" would be one the step function can never set
// going forward -- an anchor claiming what a whole run of the same plan would
// not. The payload's meaning is fixed as "what GD observed under the model's
// own convention", which on today's corpus is the same set (p2 enters no box)
// and is the safe side if that ever stops being true.
// EVERY VALUE IS THE STATE AT t0, like every other --start field. The first
// simulated tick is t0+1, so a payload written at t0+1 is one tick of motion
// too far along -- measured while testing this: lockOff handed in at t0+1 came
// out a whole dx (1.615 px) high at the first compared tick.

// since the ride's clock +0x598 was stamped, read against +0xaa0) and
// `slopeLanded` (a grounded row since then). -1 = not said. Parsed always,
// seeded only under --anchorride (cli.hpp maps them onto the ride fields).
// Version 5 adds the second body's dash: `dashing2` (p2's m_isDashing) and

//
// **id 2899 is not a reverse run but an Options trigger** (GD's
// GameOptionsTrigger). All 10 of lv22's raise/lower m_disableP1Controls, and
// while it is raised **the button is ignored entirely** -- neither a press nor
// the cube's held-button re-jump happens. The windows measured in GD
// (2026-08-18, cfg endtrace=1) are four:
//   t=13,461..14,224 / 18,259..18,612 / 19,152..19,576 / 20,110..20,487
// 1,921 ticks in total. The model thought it could jump there, and this was the
// identity of fixcensus's `m0/mini0/g1/gdg1/sp0.9/air/in1` family (edy=0.000 /
// edvy=-11.180, only the model jumps).
//
// **Why not derive it from the triggers ourselves**: which x crossing makes GD
// raise it is still unsolved. Crossing the same x of the same trigger many times
// fires it only once, and that once is not necessarily the first crossing
// (uid 18316 on the 5th, uid 18086 on the 3rd). Nor is it the distance to the
// player's y (no fire at Δ=1,236, fires at Δ=1,324). The gate is GD's camera or
// something like it, which the current model does not have. **Firing on a guess
// does more harm than good** (burning uid 18315 at its first crossing t=10,673
// creates 393 ticks of control loss that GD does not have, and on top of that
// misses the real window). So the windows are passed only "when GD knows them":
// section-anchor replays (fixcensus / quick_regress / the driver's re-anchor)
// already receive gframe and pmin/pmax from the GD dump, so this fits the same
// scheme. A cold run from the head has no such information and the model jumps
