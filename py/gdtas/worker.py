"""Lifecycle management of a single GD worker, and supplying it with plans.

A worker is "a renamed GD + a dedicated Geode root + a dedicated save + a dedicated
data root". GD has no single-instance lock, so any number of them run independently.
Always read the results from the worker's data_root (not from the repository's data dir).

The traps collected here (each one cost real debugging time, once):
  - Without Steam, GD WEDGES SILENTLY INSTEAD OF FAILING (kill does not work either).
    Check for it first.
  - steam_appid is fixed at 480 (Valve's public test appid). Grabbing 322170 makes
    the user's Steam copy of GD unable to launch.
  - Two GDs on one data root mix up result.txt and return PLAUSIBLE NUMBERS FROM A
    DIFFERENT RUN. Always confirm the worker is free before launching.
  - taskkill is asynchronous. Launching the next one without waiting for the old one
    to disappear produces the piggyback above.
  - A BOM on plan_in.txt makes the first input silently disappear (see plan.py).
  - Trust only the lines after the `serve: loaded` marker. Before the marker it is
    still the previous plan.
  - A SESSION THAT RAN TO COMPLETION NEVER READS cmd.txt AGAIN (the MOD's cmd polling
    sits inside `g_started && !g_sessionOver`). No later rerun ever lands, so the only
    way out is to reopen.
  - A hand-configured GD profile costs +400MB of private bytes. Clone the minimal one.
  - A Geode crash leaves the game's process ALIVE behind a window ("Geode Crash Handler"), and result.txt just stops:
    a launch that only watches the file learns of it when the stall timer runs out. CrashWatch notices the new
    geode/crashlogs/*.log or the window on the next poll (SessionResult.crash).
  - A crash Geode never sees (a fail-fast, abort() or std::terminate after an exception nobody caught: exit status
    0xC0000409 in ucrtbase) skips Geode's handler: no crash log and no Geode window. Windows' own error reporting takes
    the process instead -- a WerFault.exe started with `-p <pid>` keeps it alive behind its dialog -- and result.txt
    just stops the same way. CrashWatch notices a WerFault.exe reporting on one of the worker's processes, and a game
    that exits with an NTSTATUS error status is a crash too.
