"""Noticing a Geode crash the poll after it happens, checked without GD.

What is checked:
  * crash_logs lists the `.log` files of geode/crashlogs and not the `last-crashed` marker; a missing folder is no logs;
  * crash_summary names the exception, the module, the mod blamed and the top stack frames of a crash log;
  * CrashWatch ignores the logs that existed before the launch, reports a new one, and reports the crash window (title
    "Geode Crash Handler" on a window of the worker's processes) at most once a second, and no other window;
  * run_session ends a launch whose crash window stays open (the process stays alive) on the next poll instead of
    waiting for the stall timer, says so in SessionResult.crash, and does not call a quiet launch a crash;
  * Worker._collect turns a crash into a reopen that names it;
  * a crash Geode never sees (fail-fast, abort(): no crash log, no Geode window) shows as a WerFault.exe reporting on one of
    the worker's processes: wer_pids reads `-p` / `-ip` out of its command line, CrashWatch reports a worker process in
    that set (once a second, and not a process of someone else's), run_session ends the launch on it, and an exit status
    of 0xC0000409 / 0xC0000005 is a crash while 0, 1 and a signal-less stop are not.

usage: python py/test_crash_detect.py   (exit 1 on the first failure)
